# cypto_encoder
A small cryptography encoder/decoder, meant to break several types of cyphers.

In the current version, it only works with ceasar cyphers! For a cypher to be coded, it needs to follow a few instructions, and the message needs to be formatted into the script file. As the code progresses, if it does, a manual will be added to elaborate on how to create your .encode files!
